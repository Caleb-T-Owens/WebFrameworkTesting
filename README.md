# WebFrameworkTesting

Welcome to my web framework testing repo, I am making some test apps to help me decide what framework I would like to use for my planning app. I am licencing all of test apps under the MIT licence so you can use these however you like so feel free to modify them to see which framework you would like to use for your next projects too.

## What will this test app be like?

For this to be a fair test I will be making the same site which will consist of a main page that sells a product and a documentation page that talks about how to use the product.
I will not be marking the pages on how they look, but instead I will be marking them on how maintainable and easy to code they are.

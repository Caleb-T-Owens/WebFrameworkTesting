# What are my thoughts on vue?

## Vue is great

### Why?

Vue is an amazing and powerful framework that will cover most normal site building needs. It's vue templates are simple to use and provide an amazing experience while building a site. When I had my templates made it was just so pleasant to use. It is really good for making sites that are mostly static in design with little change in the layout. One of the selling points was that it was great for single page apps, if by this you mean that it is good for a site that is constantly changing its content on the same page I would definitely disagree with that statement (I wrote about that here)[#Whyisthis].

### Why not?

Why not to use Vue! I have a few reasons for why you may not want to use vue js. The first thing that detracts me from using vue is the event based programming that you need to use to route information. Unless I'm missing something about some `main.js` script file that you can put your main scripts in that starts at runtime I don't think that programming in vue is right for me. Another little gripe was that I couldn't add or subtract elements like you can do with DOM elements.

## Vue is the wrong tool for my job

### What is my job

I need to make a site that has very dynamic pages that I can easily animate and have fluid element additions for.

### Why is this?

Why is vue the wrong tool for this job? As I have sort of already said, I need to have that access to be able to rapidly and easily add and remove elements. There is the seen property but this isn't adding or removing elements dynamically which is really necessary for this project. I would also like to have a main js or ts file where all the code stems from but from what I have seen vue do this which is an issue for me because I would like to have all the code and networking in that one place or in modules from that one place.

### The light at the end of the tunnel

While this is not suitable for my task for now, it could still be good for the front page with its amazing components that can be used in many ways, it really lends itself to be used for making lots of pages fairly efficiently so it would be great if you were taking on many commissions or selling lots of sites, you could make just minor tweaks to make many unique and effective sites.
